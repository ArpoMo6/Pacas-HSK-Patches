What if we were to finally discover dinosaur DNA sequences, despite being incomplete, and fill the blanks with various genome sequences spliced from left and right, with a little bit of imagination to help guide us?<br><br>
Wonder no more! A group of Glitterworld scientists, having long abandoned the ideals to terraform the rimworlds with a purpose, went out of their ways to answer just that. With the mechanoids long having gone haywire with their terraforming projects, the dinosaurs created in labs were slowly introduced into fauna that should otherwise have resembled a 21st Century Earth, with little to no care as to their compatibility with existing wildlife and the forsaken rimworld colonists, the latter of which nobody seems to care about anyway.<br>
