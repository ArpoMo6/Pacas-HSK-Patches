  <Moonsilk.description>Moonsilk, a special product of the Rabbie Empire. \n\nThis fabric emits a pale blue light as if it contained some light of the moon. Woven at molecular level to create the ideal strength and texture. Lunar researchers are certain that Moonsilk will eventually be sought for throughout the universe, yet the prohibitive costs mean that it may be too difficult to even meet the demands of the Rabbies themselves.</Moonsilk.description>
